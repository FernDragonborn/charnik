# Charnik — D&D Character Tracking System (Plan)

> Index doc. Companions: [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) · [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) ·
> `FRONTEND.md` (written at roadmap P7.5) · [research/existing-generators.md](./research/existing-generators.md)

## Context

Greenfield project (`D:\data\code\charnik`). FOSS, **standalone desktop (Tauri)** app for
D&D **5e (2014) + 5.5e (2024)**. **Scope is a full character TRACKING system**, not just a
sheet generator. Three roles in one UI:
1. **Build & level-up** — create a character and advance it level by level.
2. **Play tracking** — live state during play (HP, slots, resources, conditions,
   concentration, rests, XP…).
3. **Compendium / database browser** — view, search, sort everything loaded from CSV.

Core intent:
- **Standalone desktop app (Tauri)** — the 99% use case; data is **local files on disk**.
  **Windows + Linux** (macOS ~free). **No HTTP server** → LAN/remote access is **not** a
  goal. **Responsive** kept as a light nicety (window resize), not a phone-over-LAN driver.
- **Max simple, minimal over-engineering.** FOSS.
- Content stored in **CSV** (not a DB) — obvious, editable by non-technical users in
  Excel/LibreOffice. Ships **SRD-only by default**; adding more is **very easy**.
- User can do **everything from the visual UI** — never forced to touch files.
- **Localization** (UI + content), **EN + UK**, extensible to ANY locale incl. RTL.
  Locales are data-driven, never hardcoded.
- **3.5 OUT OF SCOPE.** 5e + 5.5e only.
- Stat-generator UX reference: <https://5e.tools/statgen.html#pointbuy>

### Licensing basis
- 5e on **SRD 5.1**, 5.5e on **SRD 5.2.1**, both **CC-BY-4.0** (permanent, app-ok,
  commercial-ok; attribute). Default data = SRD only; excluded stuff (Beholder,
  Artificer, Aasimar…) not shipped — users add their own. WotC Fan Content Policy bans
  apps but is irrelevant (we use the CC route). Show attribution in the UI (About).
- **Three-layer repo licensing** (DECIDED): **code = AGPL-3.0-or-later** (root `LICENSE`;
  SPDX `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later` header per source file — disclose
  modifications, incl. over a network) · **bundled data = CC-BY-4.0** (`content/LICENSE`
  + `content/ATTRIBUTION.md`, WotC SRD credit) · **user homebrew = author-owned** (app
  relicenses nothing). Summary lives in root `COPYING.md` + README "Licensing".
- **Per-source license metadata**: every `source` carries its own `license` +
  `attribution` columns in the content model, so shipped SRD (CC-BY) and community/homebrew
  sources (any license) coexist and the About/Compendium UI can credit each correctly.

## Effects & modifier engine (the core auto-calc) — DECIDED

The pivotal design. Goal: **derived stats update automatically from effects** (species
traits, class features, feats, equipped items, conditions), and the user can see and
trust what happened.

- **Bounded effect vocabulary + text fallback.** Effects are structured data from a
  **fixed vocabulary**, NOT an executed mini-language (also a security win — content is
  never code; see SECURITY.md):
  - `bonus:<target>:<±N>` where target ∈ {AC, save.<abil>, skill.<name>, attack,
    damage, speed, hpMax, init, abilityScore.<abil>, passive.<skill>, …}
  - `set`/`override:<target>:<value>`
  - `advantage`/`disadvantage:<target>` flag
  - `grant:proficiency|expertise:<target>`
  - `resist`/`immune`/`vulnerable:<damageType>`
  - `apply:condition:<id>`
  - `grant:resource:<id>`
  Anything outside the vocab = **free text + an optional manual modifier** the user
  toggles. No Turing-complete DSL (avoids Aurora's swamp; stays testable).
- **Expressiveness = three layers, never code-in-CSV** (DECIDED; see SECURITY.md #4):
  **L1** the bounded vocab above (data; ~95%); **L2** safe value-expressions (`1d4`,
  `prof*2`, `ceil(level/2)`) via OUR dice+arithmetic parser — non-Turing-complete,
  whitelisted vars, no `eval`; **L3** plugins for the long tail. Plugins compose on the
  engine seam: first-party/signed handlers = trusted; **community plugins run in a
  QuickJS-in-WASM sandbox** (`quickjs-emscripten`) with a narrow host API returning
  `{value, trace}`, hard time/memory limits, no DOM/Tauri/fs/network. **Design the plugin
  registry seam early** (cheap) even though the sandbox itself is deferred until demand.
  `effects.csv` is a real user-extendable content type; ship its curated catalog WITH the
  engine/vocab (P4), not before — there is no SRD "effects table" to convert from.
- **Modifier stacking pipeline** (single, well-defined order; one abstraction, no ad-hoc
  bonuses): `base → ability mod → proficiency → item → feature → condition → override`,
  then clamp to score caps (20 normal, 30 epic; half-feat +1 handled in source step).
- **Explainable values (provenance).** Every derived value is computed as **value +
  trace**, not a bare number: the trace lists each contribution `{source, op, amount}`
  plus any **rule notes / blocks**. The UI exposes it on **hover (desktop) / tap
  (touch)** for any stat or modifier — e.g. an AC breakdown, or *"can't cast: wearing
  medium armor without medium-armor proficiency → spellcasting blocked + disadvantage on
  STR/DEX rolls."* **Rule-based penalties/blocks** (not only flat bonuses) surface here,
  so the user always sees **why**.
- **Effects panel** (UI): lists **all effects currently active** on the character (with
  their source); shows **which the engine auto-applied** (recognized vocab) **vs which
  are text-only/manual** (couldn't parse) so nothing is silently lost.
- **Custom & temporary effects (runtime).** Beyond content-defined effects, the user can
  **add ad-hoc effects on a character** via a **"+" in the effects panel**: a dropdown
  offers a **predefined catalog** (Bless, Bane, Haste, cover, Guidance… — sourced from an
  **`effects.csv`** content type, so it's localizable/extensible like all content) **plus
  a "Custom…" entry**. A custom effect = a name + one or more **bounded-vocab modifiers**
  (same vocab) and/or **free text + a manual modifier**. These live in **runtime/
  play-state**, not the build.
- **Optional duration.** Any active effect may carry an optional **duration in
  rounds/turns** (blank = until removed). A lightweight **round counter** (advance-round /
  end-encounter control) decrements durations; at 0 the effect **auto-expires** (with a
  notice). Rests expire temporary effects as appropriate; manual remove anytime.
- **Optional & removable BY DESIGN** (runtime *and* code-level — de-risk: if the engine
  proves flaky, it can be cut without breaking the app). Three levels:
  1. **Runtime toggle** — user turns effects-auto off → stats become manual/text-only.
  2. **Config default** — ship it on or off.
  3. **Build-time removable** — the effects engine is a **single isolated module**
     (`src/lib/effects/`) composed **on top of** the rules core via **one seam**
     (`applyEffects(derived, active)`). The rules core computes correct **base** derived
     stats with **no dependency** on the effects module, and the derived-value contract
     `{value, trace, notes}` the UI consumes is **identical** whether effects are on
     (trace includes effect contributions), off, or **deleted** (trace = base only).
  So removing the module + the one seam call leaves a fully working app — every stat is
  manually overridable, effects just show as text. **Core tests never import effects.**

### Rules core + effects engine (P4, IMPLEMENTED — `src/lib/rules/` + `src/lib/effects/`)
- `rules/pipeline.ts`: the **`{value, trace, notes}` contract** — `Contribution {source,
  layer, op, amount, note}` + `fold()` (stacking order base→ability→proficiency→item→
  feature→condition→override; `set` overrides, `mult` scales, `add` accumulates; clamp).
- `rules/core.ts`: pure per-value functions returning `Computed` — `abilityModifier`,
  `proficiencyBonus`, `savingThrow`, `skillCheck` (expertise/half-prof), `passiveScore`,
  `initiative`, `spellSaveDC`, `spellAttackBonus`, `unarmoredAC`/`armoredAC` (dex caps),
  `maxHpForClass` (SRD fixed), `carryingCapacity`. 5e/5.5e share the formulas; only the
  encumbrance variant branches on `system`. **No import of effects.**
- `effects/index.ts`: the **isolated engine** — `parseEffect` (bounded vocab, unknown →
  inert text), `applyEffects(targetKey, base, active)` (the single seam: folds matching
  numeric tokens onto a core `Computed`, non-numeric → notes; empty effects = identical
  value/trace = the on/off invariant), `collectFlags` (advantage/condition/resource/
  resist/proficiency facts). Imports core *types* only, never the reverse.
- Tests: golden SRD values, `describe.each(['5e','5.5e'])`, fast-check (mod formula,
  proficiency bounds, save = mod+prof), the seam on/off invariant, unknown-token survival.
  **TODO**: wire a character → all-derived-stats aggregator; L2 value-expressions (`1d4`,
  `prof*2`); ability-score-bonus cascade; advantage/disadvantage resolution in rolls.

## Feature requirements

### Calculators / automation
- Point-buy stat generator (5e.tools-style) + standard array + manual/rolled.
- Ability modifiers auto; **proficiency + expertise** toggles on skills/saves.
- ASI from correct source per system (5e: species; 5.5e: background) + level-up
  ASIs/feats. **Feat/ASI slots are per-class at class-specific levels** (Fighter
  4/6/8/12/14/16/19; most 4/8/12/16/19; Rogue +10); prerequisites respected.
- **Free-feat mode**: default RAW; user may add extra feats at ANY level (house rule);
  RAW slots vs free additions tracked distinctly.
- Initiative, spell save DC, spell attack, weapon attack+damage — auto (via engine).
- **All passive senses** (Perception, Investigation, Insight, extensible) = 10 + mod
  (+prof/expertise, ±5 adv/disadv).
- **Carrying capacity + carried weight** — **optional (toggle)**: carry = STR×15×size
  (Tiny ×0.5, S/M ×1, Large ×2, Huge ×4, Garg ×8); push/drag/lift = ×2; over carry →
  speed 5 ft (5.5e core). **Variant encumbrance tiers** — separate toggle, **5e-only /
  optional in 5.5e**: STR×5 → Encumbered (−10), STR×10 → Heavily (−20 + disadv on
  STR/DEX/CON checks/attacks/saves). Size-scaled.
- **Metric in parentheses** next to imperial (ft→m ×0.3048, lb→kg ×0.4536).

### Character lifecycle (build → level-up → play)
- **Creation**: choose system, species, background, class, ability scores, etc.
- **Level-up flow** (first-class feature): advance a level → apply HP (roll/avg/fixed),
  new class features, ASI-or-feat at slot levels, new spells/slots, proficiency growth.
  Works for single- and multiclass.
- **Multiclass** (in scope, incl. spellcasting): ability prereqs, partial proficiencies
  on entry, HP per class, ASI count by total level, **multiclass spell-slot table**,
  per-class spell save DC / prepared lists, Pact Magic kept separate.
- **XP tracking** — **fully optional**: a `xp` field + a `levelingMode`
  (`milestone` | `xp`) toggle. In `xp` mode, level derives from XP thresholds and
  accumulated XP is tracked. Milestone mode ignores XP.

### Spellcasting model (slots · known/prepared · resources) — DESIGN, not yet built

The single most rules-heavy subsystem. Designed up front (rebuilding it piecemeal is worse
than designing it once). Split cleanly into **data (CSV)**, **rules (pure TS)**, and
**play-state**; the fiddly logic honestly stays in code — CSV holds the tables, not the rules
that consume them.

**Resolved forks (decided with the user):**
1. **Unify slot = resource.** ONE "castable pools" engine: a slot *is* a recharge-typed
   resource tagged with a spell level {id, spellLevel?, max, recharge, castsSpell?}. Class slots
   = resources keyed by level (recharge long); pact = recharge short; item/arcanum = own
   recharge. UI still renders level-tagged pools as pips, non-level ones as trackers. Collapses
   L2/L5/item-slots/arcanum into one mechanism.
2. **Per-class picker ONLY when multiclass.** Single caster class → one flat list (the common
   path). 2+ caster classes → per-class blocks, each with its own known/prepared cap and source
   list; a spell on two lists (Cure Wounds on cleric+bard) is attributed to the class the player
   picks it under. No new complexity for the 99% single-class case.
3. **Generalized `known-set`.** Every prepared/known caster has a `known-set`; the difference is
   only how it's **populated** — wizard = spellbook (owned subset, grows, editable); sorcerer/
   bard/ranger = self-known list; cleric/druid = a curated **Prepared Spells set** (see below).
   Prepared = pick from known-set, sized by data.

**Data (CSV):**
- **`spell_slots.csv`** — 4 SRD `kind`s (`full`/`half`/`third`/`pact`), matrix form: row =
  character level, columns = `slot_1..slot_9` (count of slots of each spell level). The `full`
  table doubles as the **multiclass** table (indexed by effective caster level). Per-root
  (edition slot/access differences). **Rules tables, not per-source content** — a class
  **references** its table by id (`slot_table: full` / `slot_table: mysrc:custom`); the app never
  guesses which file is which (see Content type identification).
- **Caster profile** columns on `classes.csv` / `subclasses.csv` (EK/AT are third-casters
  granted by a **subclass** at class level 3 — caster-ness can come from the subclass, gated by
  its grant level): `caster_kind`, `prepare_style (prepared|known)`, `spell_ability`, `ritual`,
  `slot_table`.
- **`class_casting.csv`** (linked `class_id`+`level`, per-edition) — per-class-level
  `cantrips_known` and the **known/prepared-set size**. In **2024** this is a **table count**
  (verified from SRD 5.2.1: cleric "Prepared Spells" column — start 4 @L1, grows, chosen from the
  class list, only levels you have slots for, swap on Long Rest). Whether **2014** uses a formula
  (`mod + level`) instead is **NOT asserted from memory** — pull from real SRD 5.1 when building
  (see data-defect note). Either way the size is **descriptor data, per-edition**, not hardcoded.
- **Spell→class access = inline `spells.classes` + additive `spell_lists.csv` join.** Inline is
  convenient for shipped SRD; but a homebrew class (e.g. Artificer) must NOT edit shipped spell
  rows, so it ships its OWN additive `spell_lists_<pack>.csv` (`class_id,spell_id`) pointing at
  existing spell ids. The loader builds the access map as the **union** of both. (Revises the
  earlier "spell_lists not needed" note — needed for extensibility. Additive-only for now; a
  `deny` flag to subtract is far-backlog.)
- **Resources = data + effect tokens.** Anything "N/day" (Mystic Arcanum, item "cast X 3/day",
  innate 1/day) is a resource: `grant-resource:<id>:<max>:<recharge>`; a spell carries
  `cast_via: slot | resource:<id> | at-will`. `grant-slot:<level>` for the rare artifact granting
  a real slot (a resource with a spell level, per fork 1).

**Rules (pure TS core):** `effectiveCasterLevel` — multiclass slots are the **SUM** of caster
contributions (Σ full-levels + Σ⌊half/2⌋ + Σ⌊third/3⌋; Artificer rounds ½ **up**; **warlock
levels don't count** — Pact Magic fully separate), indexing the ONE multiclass (full) table —
**not** the highest/senior class. Single-class uses its own `kind` table by its level.
`slotPool` (table + `grant-slot`; levels stack); known/prepared caps; resource resolver; the
highest spell level you can **learn/prepare** is capped by your level **in that class** (slots
may exceed it → upcast); upcast + cantrip scaling (later).

**Play-state (schema already fits):** `spellSlotsSpent` keyed `"1".."9"` + `"pact"`;
`resourcesSpent` keyed by id. Only resource **definitions** are derived (not stored in play).

**Logic hazards still to mind while building:**
- **L4** wizard top tier = the **class spell LIST** (bounded set via access map, level-gated) —
  **not** "every spell in the game"; then spellbook (known) ⊂ list, prepared ⊂ spellbook.
- **L6** subclass casters activate at the subclass grant level (gate in builder).
- **L7** always-prepared (domain/oath/Magic Initiate) is **outside** the prepared-set count, but
  still counts as a class spell.
- **L8** rituals cast without preparation/slot — "castable" ≠ "prepared".
- **L9** cantrips are independent of slots (pure warlock has 0 shared slots but has cantrips).

**Data defect to fix first (found while verifying SRD):** the shipped **2014** class-feature
prose is **truncated** — cleric Spellcasting text in `srd-2014` is just "you can cast cleric
spells", missing the mechanics. So 2014 casting rules can't be read from our data yet. Backfill
2014 class features from the full SRD 5.1 before encoding `class_casting` for 2014.

### Play-state tracking
- HP current/temp/max, hit dice used, **death saves**, exhaustion.
- **Spell slots used**, prepared/known management, **re-prepare on long rest**.
- **Resources** used (Ki, Rage, Sorcery/Channel/Bardic, item charges…) AND **custom
  resources** declared by homebrew (name, max formula, recharge: short/long/dawn/custom).
- **Conditions** (poisoned/frightened/prone/exhaustion…) that feed the effects engine.
- **Concentration**: track which spell; prompt on damage. (Aurora failed here.)
- **Active effects**: list of content/condition/custom effects currently applied, each
  with optional remaining **duration (rounds)**; a **round counter** advances and
  auto-expires them (see Effects engine).
- **Equipped vs carried / attuned (3 slots)** — equip/attune state drives AC, attacks,
  and effect bonuses.
- **Rests**: short/long rest actions restore HP / hit dice / slots / per-rest resources;
  5.5e long rest −1 exhaustion.

### Character sheet fields (verified vs official UA 5.5e sheet)
Identity: name, player, species, class(es)+levels, subclass, background, alignment,
XP/level, **size**, **photo**. Abilities + mods + saving throws; skills w/
prof/expertise; AC, **shield**, initiative, speed (ft+m); HP/temp/max, hit dice,
death saves; **proficiency bonus**; **Heroic Inspiration**; passive senses; conditions.
Attacks: name, atk/save bonus, damage & type, **mastery (Прийоми)**. Spellcasting:
ability mod, save DC, attack; slots (lvl 1-9, total/used); spells table (level, name,
casting time, **concentration/ritual/material К/Р/М**, notes, prepared/known). Inventory
w/ per-item weight → totals + (optional) capacity; **attunement (3 slots)**; currency
cp/sp/ep/gp/pp. **Optional appearance** (age, height, weight, eyes, skin, hair, marks).
**Notes** (free-form). UA official terms (CON = Статура) seed the `uk` locale.

**Separate sections — NOT one blob**: Class features · Species traits · Feats ·
Armor/weapon proficiencies · Tool proficiencies · Languages — each its own section.

### Compendium / browser
- Browse every content type. **Search respects active system, or across both** when the
  user picks "all". Sort/filter: spells by level/school/(class, casting time…); generic
  sort/filter elsewhere.
- **Content-health view**: diagnostics over loaded content — broken references, missing
  translations, ID collisions, malformed rows. Valuable since content is user-edited.

### Custom content types (add + persist via UI forms)
Species (+subraces), Backgrounds, Classes, Subclasses, Class features (per level),
Feats, Spells, Weapons (+mastery), Armor & shields, Gear (weight), Tools & tool profs,
Fighting styles & maneuvers, Languages, Conditions, Damage types/schools, Skills,
**Effect packages** (`effects.csv` — predefined buffs/debuffs feeding the effects-panel
catalog; carry bounded-vocab `effects` + optional default duration), optional Magic
items. Each may carry **effects** (bounded vocab).

### Roster, dice, logging, runtime switches
- **Roster**: manage many characters — list/create/duplicate/delete/search.
- **Dice roller** (in scope): roll with computed modifiers (attacks/saves/skills/damage),
  adv/disadv.
- **Change-log** (in scope): optional per-character event history (leveled up, took
  damage, spent slot…), stored as **append-only `log.jsonl`** (NOT in `character.json`,
  so it doesn't bloat it; capped/rotated).
- **Runtime switches, no restart**: language · **active system (5e↔5.5e) for browsing/
  creation** · theme (light/dark + custom). **Live CSV reload** via file watcher
  (debounced; reparse changed file only; manual refresh fallback).
- **System is a property of the CHARACTER, not a free toggle.** A built character is
  **bound to the system it was created in** (stored in its JSON) and always renders in
  it — you don't reinterpret a 5e character as 5.5e. The active-system switch only sets
  the **compendium/creation** context. **Converting a character between systems is OUT
  of scope** (mechanics differ too much); a character stays in its system.
- **PWA deferred** (not dropped): responsive covers phone-over-LAN; PWA only adds
  install/offline-shell, low value while data lives on the server.
- **Accessibility baseline (in scope)**: proper **keyboard navigation** from the start —
  correct **Tab / Shift+Tab** focus order, visible focus, ARIA roles/labels; **command/search
  palette in two scopes — `Ctrl+K` = GLOBAL** (all content + every character) and
  **`Ctrl+Shift+K` = LOCAL** = search the **active character's OWN content** (their spells,
  items, features, actions, conditions, notes) — a "find on this character", NOT page-text
  search; it's only list-heavy on **Spellbook / Inventory / Compendium**, which additionally
  get an **inline list filter**. **Only the GLOBAL search sits in the header**; the
  **local/view search lives INSIDE the view** (the list's own search/filter box, e.g.
  Inventory's item filter, the Spellbook search) — `Ctrl+Shift+K` just focuses it; it is NOT
  a header button. **Views switch** via a **tab bar** (Profile · Combat · Inventory · Build),
  `Ctrl+1..4`, or the palette. **All shortcuts match the PHYSICAL key (`e.code`, e.g.
  `KeyK`/`Digit1`), never `e.key`** — so they work on any keyboard layout (Cyrillic etc.),
  not only English. (Also: every internal link/navigation, incl. the palette's `goto`, must
  prefix `base` from `$app/paths` or it 404s under the GitHub Pages subpath.)
  **Every scrollable/selectable list is
  arrow-key navigable**: ↑/↓ move a highlighted item, **Enter activates it (identical to a
  left-click)**, Home/End jump, type-ahead where useful — applies uniformly to the command
  palette, spell/attack lists, roll log, compendium, and every dropdown. Cheaper now than
  retrofitting; details in `FRONTEND.md` (P7.5).
- **Content-pack sharing (in scope)**: export a whole **`source`** as a portable set
  (its CSVs, optionally zipped) so users can share homebrew packs; import re-uses the
  collision/health flow. (Distinct from per-character bundle export.)

---

## Content sources & loading

- `charnik.config.json` lists **content root folders** (e.g. `<dataDir>/content/core/`,
  `<dataDir>/content/homebrew/`); app scans + merges. Any number of CSVs per type
  (`species_srd.csv`, `species_phb.csv`…), merged by type.
- **Enable/disable BOTH per-file AND per-`source`-tag** (independent toggles in UI):
  `enabled(row) = fileEnabled AND sourceEnabled`. Add/remove roots in UI.
- **Add content via app**: per-type forms write rows into a homebrew CSV
  (`papaparse.unparse`). App **only writes files it owns**; never rewrites hand-edited
  user files. Writes are **atomic** (temp→rename), **UTF-8 BOM + CRLF** for Excel.
- **In-memory indexed content graph**: on load, build indices (by id, type, system) and
  resolve references; no repeated linear scans.

### IDs & duplicates
- Identity = **`type:source:id`** (type-scoped, source-namespaced). *Refinement found in
  P4 impl*: slugs are unique **per type**, not globally — e.g. `shield` is both a spell and
  an item, so `source:id` alone collides; the **type** must scope identity. Same id across
  sources still coexists (`spell:SRD 5.1:fireball` vs `spell:SRD 5.2.1:fireball`). Links
  (class→features, character→content) and the loader index use this key.
- **Duplicate-group detector** surfaces "same `type:id` base across sources"; resolution
  stored in a **separate `collisions.json`**: *keep one* (pick winner) or *keep all*
  (distinct, default). Exact `type:source:id` clash within one source = error (auto-suffix).

### Content loader (P4, IMPLEMENTED — `src/lib/content/loader.ts`)
`loadContent(storage, roots)` → a `ContentGraph`. **Storage-agnostic** (Tauri fs / node-fs /
in-memory / read-only fetch — serves desktop AND web). Per root: reads `_pack.json` defaults,
lists `*.csv`, infers type from `<filebase>_*.csv`, parses (papaparse) + validates
(`parseRow`/zod). Builds `byType`, `byEffectiveId` (`type:source:id`), and **`articles`**
(`type:id` → all editions/sources, powering the 5e↔5.5e toggle). Discovers **locales** from
`name_/text_` columns (BCP-47 guardrail). **Robustness is output, not exceptions**: invalid
rows / unknown files / malformed locale columns / duplicate ids become `issues`
(content-health), never throws; `get()` returns `undefined` and **`resolveRefs()`** reports
missing referenced ids so the render layer can "render what's possible + flag it".
`featuresForClass()` resolves the class→features linked table. Tested in-memory + against the
real shipped content (658 spells, 531 monsters load with zero errors). `NodeStorage`
(`src/lib/storage/node.ts`) added for those integration tests. **Note**: spell→class access =
inline `spells.classes` **plus** an additive `spell_lists.csv` join (so homebrew classes add
access without editing shipped spells — see Spellcasting model). **TODO**: `spell_slots.csv` +
`class_casting.csv` + `spell_lists.csv` join (see Spellcasting model), explicit type
declaration + UI type-assign (see Content type identification), backfill truncated 2014
class-feature prose from SRD 5.1, `collisions.json` read/write, wire `charnik.config.json` for
roots.

### Content type identification (which CSV is what) — DESIGN

Users add their own CSVs and **organize them into folders freely**, so the app can't rely on
one rigid convention to know a file's **type** (schema). Two separate concerns, don't conflate:
- **(a) What TYPE is this CSV?** (schema) — precedence, first match wins:
  1. **Explicit declaration** (survives any name/folder): a first-line directive
     `#charnik-type: spell_slots`, or a `_pack.json` map (`{ "files": { "x.csv": "spell_slots" },
     "globs": { "slots_*": "spell_slots" } }`).
  2. **Filename convention** (current behaviour): `<filebase>_*.csv` → type. Zero-config for the
     shipped SRD and anyone who follows it.
  3. **Ask in the UI**: an unrecognized file is **never silently dropped** — it's surfaced in
     content-health and the user assigns its type once (persisted to the manifest).
- **(b) What ROLE does a row play / who uses it?** — already solved by **references**, not
  guessing. A class points at its slot table (`slot_table: full`), a character points at content
  by `type:source:id`. The app never infers "this file is warlock's slots" from a filename.
- **Column-fingerprint auto-detection** (infer type from the column set) — **rejected as a
  primary mechanism** (localization/custom columns make it unreliable, schemas overlap). Parked
  on the **very-far backlog** ("someday, maybe" — only as a last-resort hint, never authoritative).
- This is a **general** content problem (any user content), not spellcasting-specific.

### Per-system fidelity (5e vs 5.5e)
A row tagged `systems=5e,5.5e` means mechanics are **identical** in both. When they
differ: **split into two rows** (one per system, shared base id) for big differences, or
use **per-system override columns** (e.g. `mastery@5.5e`) for small ones. Don't force
one row to lie about both.

## Data model (CSV)
- Common columns: `id`, `systems`, `source`, `name_en/uk`, `text_en/uk`, **`effects`**
  (bounded-vocab, `;`-separated), + type-specific mechanics columns.
- **Localization = L2 suffixed columns** (all languages side-by-side; missing → EN
  fallback; add language = add `name_xx`/`text_xx`).
  - **Loader discovers content locales from these columns** (union with UI-catalog
    locales; EN always present as fallback). The active locale's search/sort reads
    `name_<code>`/`text_<code>` and falls back to `_en` per missing cell, so a row that
    has e.g. `name_es` is findable under Spanish.
  - **Guardrail (avoid the foot-gun):** the suffix MUST be a validated **BCP-47 code**
    (`es`, `uk`, `pt-BR`) via a strict `^(name|text)_[a-z]{2,3}(-[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$` grammar —
    NOT a free-form name (`name_spanish`). Columns that don't match the grammar are
    **flagged in content-health, never silently treated as a locale** (prevents phantom/
    duplicate locales from typos like `spanish` vs `es` vs `es-ES`). Enumerate once at load.
- **Nested via linked tables**: `class_features.csv` keyed by `class_id` + `level` (incl.
  ASI/feat slot levels). **Resource defs** as columns/linked rows.
- Multi-value cells: `;` delimiter; small JSON blob only where unavoidable.
- **`schemaVersion`** present in content + character files from day 1 (migrations).
- **Per-type schema + validation** (e.g. `zod`): one schema per content type, **shared**
  by the loader, the content-editor forms, and the content-health view (required columns,
  types, valid `systems`, valid effect vocab). Bad rows are flagged, not crashed on.
- **Spell modeling** needs structured columns for components/range/area/duration and
  **upcasting + cantrip scaling** (semi-structured) — design carefully in P3.

### Finalized column model (P3, IMPLEMENTED — `src/lib/content/schemas.ts`)
zod schemas per type, validated by `parseRow(type, row)`; co-located test
`schemas.test.ts` also asserts **every shipped SRD row validates** (data↔schema gate).
Common columns on every type: `id` (lowercase slug; identity = `source:id`), `systems`
(comma list over `5e,5.5e`), `source`, `name_en/uk`, `text_en/uk`, `effects`
(`;`-sep bounded-vocab tokens, validated by kind prefix). Type-specific:
- **species** `size, speed, creature_type` (5e ASI rides in `effects`; 5.5e splits it to background → ASI rows are usually system-split).
- **class** (`classes_*.csv`) `hit_die, primary_ability, saves(2), caster(full/half/third/pact/none), spell_ability, skills_choose, skills_from, subclass_level`.
- **class_feature** (`class_features_*.csv`, linked by `class_id`+`level`) `class_id, level, resource`.
- **background** (`backgrounds_*.csv`) `skills, tools, languages, ability_choices, origin_feat` (last two = 5.5e).
- **feat** (`feats_*.csv`) `category(origin/general/fighting-style/epic-boon/general-2014), prereq, repeatable`.
- **spell** (`spells_*.csv`) `level, school, casting_time, range, components, material, duration, concentration, ritual, classes, resolution(attack/save/auto/none), save_ability, damage, higher_level`. Caster-wide DC/attack are **computed, never stored**.
- **item** (`items_*.csv`) `category, item_type, cost, weight_lb, properties, damage, damage_type, range, ac, armor_dex_cap("" full / "2" medium / "0" heavy), str_min, stealth_disadvantage, attunement, rarity`.
- **condition** (`conditions_*.csv`) `negative` (crimson vs teal); mechanics in `effects`.
- **effect** (`effects_*.csv`, runtime "+" catalog) `kind(bounded vocab), target, op, value, duration_rounds`.
- **Pack manifest** `content/<root>/_pack.json` carries `schemaVersion, source, license,
  attribution, systems` for the whole pack → rows don't repeat license/version; per-row
  `source` still allowed so packs merge. (Supersedes a per-row `schema_version` column.)
- **TODO (later)**: 2024 subclass-level overrides (all level 3) via per-system override
  column rather than the seeded 2014 `subclass_level`; bulk SRD fill beyond the seed.

### "Articles" + edition toggle (UI/model)
A single content row is an **"article"**. When an article exists in BOTH editions (same
base slug across `SRD 5.1`/5e and `SRD 5.2.1`/5.5e — e.g. `fireball`, `longsword`,
`barbarian`), the **article view and search results carry a 5e↔5.5e toggle**. The two
versions are distinct rows (`source:id` differs, `systems` differs); the loader/UI groups
them by base slug. This is a **per-article local** switch (compendium/search), distinct
from the global `activeSystem` context.

### Data-model refinements surfaced by the full SRD extraction (TODO, non-blocking)
The schema accepted everything (all rows validate) — `effects` + verbatim `text_en` absorb
the rest — but a few things sit in text that would be better structured. Add via
`schemaVersion` migration, in priority order:
1. **`spell_lists.csv` linked table** (spell_id × class_id). SRD 5.1 lists class spell
   lists separately, so 2014 spells have an empty `classes` column; a linked table fixes
   both editions uniformly (supersedes the inline `spell.classes` string).
2. **`mastery` column on item** (5.5e weapon mastery) — currently folded into `properties`.
3. **Species ability bonuses → `effects`** (`flat-bonus:con+2`) instead of only prose
   (5e: on species; 5.5e: on background); model **subraces/lineages** (e.g. Elf lineages).
4. **Monster**: optionally structure `saving_throws`, `damage_resist/immune`,
   `condition_immune`, `legendary_actions`, `proficiency_bonus` (now all in `text_en`).
5. **`resource`** on class features (rage/ki counts) — currently unparsed.
None block the loader; they raise fidelity where the UI later wants structured filters.

### Shipped SRD content (P3 — `content/srd/*.csv`, GENERATED not hand-written)
**Hard rule: content is never authored from memory.** Every row is parsed from the
official **CC-BY-4.0 SRD 5.2.1** markdown by converters in `tools/srd/` (source mirror:
downfallx/dnd-5e-srd-markdown; see `tools/srd/README.md`). Each converter **asserts its
row count against the source**, so a dropped entry fails loudly. Tagged `5.5e` (2024 SRD;
not claimed as `5e` — 2024 diverges). Current (all 5.5e):
**339 spells, 390 items** (38 weapons · 13 armor · 81 gear · 258 magic), **174 class
features, 17 feats, 15 conditions, 12 classes, 9 species, 4 backgrounds**. Structured
columns are parsed from the text, blank where ambiguous, never guessed; verbatim text in
`text_en`; within-file id clashes auto-suffixed (`-2`).
- **Rejected source**: BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd (OGL 1.0a, not CC-BY; SRD 5.0).
- **Not seeded** (deliberate): the runtime `effects` quick-pick catalog (an app concern,
  not a raw SRD type); subclasses; monsters. **5e/SRD-5.1 pass** (Tabyltop/CC-SRD) pending.

---

## Localization (UI)
Per-locale **runtime JSON message catalogs** (`en.json`, `uk.json`): `t("key")` →
string; `{var}` interpolation + plurals; missing key → **EN fallback**. Runtime
catalogs (e.g. `svelte-i18n`) chosen so users drop in a new locale and switch live
without rebuild; locale list **discovered at runtime**; **RTL** via `dir`. Sorting uses
locale-aware `Intl.Collator`.

---

## Saved-character storage — JSON per character
`characters/<slug>/` holds: `character.json` (+ photo sibling, by name not base64) +
optional `log.jsonl`. **Schema separates build/definition from runtime/play-state**
(different lifecycles):
- **definition**: system id (the character is bound to it), `schemaVersion`,
  species/background/class+subclass, level, **chosen options** (picked skills/tools/
  fighting-style, ASI allocation, known/prepared spells — a **dedicated schema design,
  P7**: must survive content edits and be re-editable on level-up), ASI sources, separate
  proficiency/language/feat arrays, appearance.
- **runtime**: current/temp HP, hit dice used, death saves, slots used, resources used,
  active conditions, concentration, equipped/attuned, xp.
Default save = **id references only** (small, portable); **bundle export**
(`character.bundle.json`) embeds referenced content rows to open anywhere. Missing
referenced content → render what's possible + flag it. **Autosave** (debounced) +
rotating **backups** (no DB → corruption guard; atomic temp→rename).

### Character model (P7, IMPLEMENTED — `src/lib/character/`)
- `schema.ts`: zod `characterSchema` = `{ schemaVersion, id, system, build, play }` with the
  hard **build ↔ play** split. **build** = name/species/background/classes(+subclass,
  multiclass)/abilities/skills/saves/feats/inventory/spells/photo/notes/xp. **play** =
  hp(current/temp/override), hitDiceSpent, spellSlotsSpent, resourcesSpent, effects
  (runtime instances w/ optional round duration), concentration, inspiration, deathSaves,
  exhaustion, round. Content is stored as **`type:source:id` refs** (loader effectiveId),
  not copies. `newCharacter()` factory + `parseCharacter()`.
- `repository.ts`: `save/load/list/deleteCharacter` over the **`Storage`** interface
  (desktop + web), path `characters/<slug>/character.json`. Load = **parse → migrate
  (schemaVersion registry) → validate**; a corrupt/invalid/too-new save is *reported*
  (`LoadResult.error`), never thrown — the roster still lists it flagged. Roll log =
  append-only `log.jsonl` (`appendLog/readLog`), kept out of character.json.
- Tested in-memory (round-trip identity, build/play isolation, invalid-save refusal,
  corrupt-save reporting, newer-schema rejection, roster, roll log). `MemoryStorage.remove`
  made recursive to match node/Tauri. **TODO**: autosave debounce + rotating backups,
  bundle export/import, `newCharacter` slug from name in the UI layer.

---

## Data directory & config
- **`dataDir` via Tauri `path`**: default = OS **app-data dir** (`appDataDir`), with an
  optional **portable mode** (`data/` next to the exe). Holds `content/`, `characters/`,
  `charnik.config.json`, `collisions.json`.
- First run: pick/confirm `dataDir` (Tauri **dialog** folder picker) + language + system →
  written to config; overridable later in settings.
- All file IO is confined to `dataDir`/roots via the **`Storage` interface + Tauri fs
  capability scope** (see SECURITY.md).

---

## Architecture — Tauri desktop app + SvelteKit (TypeScript)
**Standalone desktop app, no HTTP server.** Shell = **Tauri v2** (Rust core + system
webview); frontend = **SvelteKit with `adapter-static` (SPA, `ssr=false`)** loaded in the
webview. **All logic is framework-agnostic TS in the core**; the only Tauri-specific part
is the IO layer.
- **File IO behind a `Storage` interface.** One narrow interface (read/write/list/watch
  within dataDir). Runtime impl = **Tauri fs** (`@tauri-apps/plugin-fs` + `-dialog` for
  folder pick + `path` API), sandboxed by Tauri **capabilities / fs-scope**. A **node/
  in-memory impl** backs tests (no Tauri needed) → core/content/character logic is fully
  testable without the shell.
- **File watching** = Tauri fs watch (NOT `chokidar` — no node runtime in the webview).
- **Minimal Rust**: mostly `tauri.conf.json` + capability files + official plugins; custom
  Rust commands only if a plugin can't cover something. (User doesn't know Rust → keep the
  Rust surface tiny.)
- **No server → no LAN/IP/auth surface** (simpler security; see SECURITY.md). LAN/phone
  access is therefore unavailable (accepted: standalone 99%).

### Second target: free web demo on GitHub Pages (desktop stays priority)
The **same `adapter-static` SPA** deploys to **GitHub Pages** — a full client-side web
version (create/track/save a character in the browser) at **zero cost** (no server exists
by design → nothing to host/pay for; public repo, CC-BY data). ~95% shared code; the whole
difference is at the **`Storage` seam** + content source:
- **Platform seam**: build flag `PUBLIC_PLATFORM=web|desktop` selects the Storage factory
  and disables desktop-only bits (file-watch, folder pick). Nothing above `Storage` changes.
- **Web Storage impl** = **IndexedDB or OPFS** (NOT localStorage — 5 MB cap too small);
  `watch` is a no-op. Characters + homebrew live here. **Persistence is browser-evictable
  → push export/download as backup.**
- **Content on web** = the bundled SRD CSVs served as **static assets via `fetch()`**
  (read-only source); the loader stays **Storage-agnostic** (a read-only fetch source +
  a browser source), so no loader changes. Homebrew still addable via forms → browser store.
- **Export/Import = same format, different transport.** Character JSON / **bundle export**
  (embeds referenced content rows) is identical across platforms → a character made on web
  opens on desktop and back, **zero conversion**. Desktop uses file dialogs; web uses
  **download / file-upload (+ drag-drop)**. For cross-device transfer prefer the **bundle**
  (web ships only SRD; desktop may have homebrew — the bundle carries the needed rows so it
  always renders fully). This is the existing bundle-export design, just wired to a download.
- **GH Pages specifics**: set `base` path (repo subpath), add SPA `404.html` fallback, CI
  workflow to build + publish. GH Pages free tier (~1 GB / 100 GB-mo) dwarfs our few-MB SPA.
- Reinforces the invariants that already make this nearly free: static SPA, all IO behind
  `Storage`, nothing above the interface imports Tauri.
- **Dev**: `pnpm tauri dev`. **Package**: `pnpm tauri build` → per-OS installers/binaries
  (Win `.exe`/`.msi`, Linux AppImage/`.deb`). **Toolchain**: Rust (rustup) + **MSVC C++
  Build Tools** on Windows; WebView2 runtime (already present); webkit2gtk on Linux. The
  TS side (SvelteKit + core + tests) scaffolds and runs **without** Rust; Tauri wiring
  needs the toolchain.

Layers (framework-agnostic core, thin Tauri/SvelteKit shell):
- **Rules core** (pure TS, tested): mods, prof, ASI per system, passive senses, optional
  capacity, attack/spell math, the **modifier stacking pipeline**; produces base derived
  values as `{value, trace, notes}` **with no dependency on effects**. Shared base +
  `5e`/`5.5e` overrides; reactive to active system.
- **Effects module** (separate, isolated, **optional/removable**): the bounded-vocab
  interpreter, composed onto the rules core via **one seam** (`applyEffects`). Disabled
  at runtime/config or excluded at build without touching core or UI (stable contract).
- **Storage interface** (the one IO seam): `read/write/list/watch` within dataDir.
  Runtime impl = **Tauri fs**; **node/in-memory impl** for tests. Everything above
  depends on the interface, not on Tauri.
- **Content store**: scan roots, parse CSV (`papaparse`), merge, build indices, detect
  collisions, filter by `systems`, resolve locale (EN fallback). **File watch via the
  Storage interface (Tauri fs watch)** → debounced live reload; **ignores self-writes**
  (no write→reload loop).
- **Character store**: load/save JSON + photo + `log.jsonl`; autosave/backups; bundle.
- **Content-source manager** · **Compendium + content-health** · **Roster** ·
  **Dice roller** · **Theme system** (CSS tokens + `data-theme`; custom themes).
- **UI**: sheet · stat generator · level-up · compendium · content editor · settings.

Libs (minimal): `papaparse`, `svelte-i18n`, `zod`; **Tauri v2** + plugins
(`@tauri-apps/api`, `plugin-fs`, `plugin-dialog`). File-watch via Tauri (no `chokidar`).

---

## Resolved decisions
1. **Stack** — **Tauri v2** desktop + **SvelteKit (`adapter-static` SPA, TS)** + **pnpm**.
   File IO behind a `Storage` interface (Tauri fs at runtime; node/in-memory for tests).
   Packaging: see #14.
2. **Systems** — 5e + 5.5e only; 3.5 out.
3. **Scope** — full character **tracking** system (build + level-up + play + compendium).
4. **Effects** — bounded vocab + text fallback; stacking pipeline; effects panel
   (auto vs manual); **global optional toggle**.
5. **Saved character** — JSON per char; **build vs runtime split**; `schemaVersion`;
   `log.jsonl` separate; bundle export; autosave + backups.
6. **Localization** — content L2 columns + EN fallback; UI runtime JSON catalogs; RTL.
7. **Content sources** — multi-root; per-file AND per-source toggles; UI forms write
   atomic UTF-8-BOM/CRLF homebrew files only.
8. **IDs** — `source:id`; duplicate resolver in separate `collisions.json`.
9. **Multiclass** — in scope, incl. spellcasting.
10. **XP** — optional `xp` field + `milestone|xp` toggle.
11. **Data dir** — portable `dataDir` next to binary, auto-filled, overridable.
12. **Dice roller, content-health view, change-log** — in scope. **PWA deferred.**
13. **Testing** → [TESTING.md]; **Security** → [SECURITY.md] (separate plans).
14. **Packaging** — **`pnpm tauri build`** → per-OS installers (Win `.exe`/`.msi`, Linux
    AppImage/`.deb`). Toolchain: **Rust (rustup) + MSVC C++ Build Tools** (Win) + WebView2
    (present); webkit2gtk (Linux). **No server / no LAN.**
15. **System per character** — bound at creation & stored in JSON; active-system switch =
    browse/creation context only. **Cross-system character conversion = out of scope.**
16. **A11y + keyboard** (Tab/Shift+Tab, visible focus, ARIA, `Ctrl+K`) and **content-pack
    sharing** (export a `source`) — in scope.
17. **SRD data** — converter from a **CC-BY** source (P3; candidates in Risks); **UK
    content = ship EN, community-fill** (no CC UA translation exists).
18. **Default theme (shipped look)** — slate base + **heraldic-crimson** accent + **gold**
    for resources; **Space Grotesk** (display) / **Inter** (body) / **JetBrains Mono**
    (data·labels). Layout = grimoire sheet: HP hero, combat tiles (AC/initiative/speed/
    passive), 6 ability tiles, **spell slots as gold "sigil" pips** (filled=available,
    dashed=spent), effects+provenance panel. Just the default token *values*; the token
    contract + light/dark/custom themes are unchanged. Detailed spec → `FRONTEND.md` (P7.5).
    **Semantic color roles (consistent everywhere):** **crimson = important / danger**
    (pinned/favourite, negative effects, destructive, primary actions like Roll/Next-turn),
    **teal/cyan = good / confirmation / positive** (available resources & slot pips, positive
    effects, temp HP, toggles-on), **gold = everything else / neutral marker** (proficiency &
    prepared dots, resource counters). On/off **dots are filled when active, hollow when
    inactive** — never a dimmed fill.

Config files: `charnik.config.json` (dataDir, roots, toggles, rule-options, settings) +
`collisions.json` (collision resolutions) — separate.

---

## Risks & open engineering notes (carry into implementation)
- **CSV write-back footguns**: UTF-8 BOM + CRLF (Excel/Cyrillic), atomic writes, app
  writes only its own files, watcher ignores self-writes. (Addressed above; verify.)
- **Multiclass spellcasting** + **concentration** + **prepared/known** = highest-bug
  modules → dedicated tests (see TESTING.md), call out in P8.
- **Tauri toolchain**: needs **Rust (rustup) + MSVC C++ Build Tools** (Win); WebView2 is
  present. Not yet installed → install before Tauri wiring (TS side scaffolds without it).
  Per-OS builds. Keep the Rust surface minimal (official plugins, little/no custom Rust).
- **Concurrency**: single desktop-app instance → multi-writer clobber largely moot; still
  use atomic writes + an mtime guard on save.
- **Undo**: change-log gives an audit trail; full undo is later if needed.
- **SRD sourcing**: hidden content-entry labor → **converter script** (P3). CC-BY
  candidate inputs: `downfallx/dnd-5e-srd-markdown` (5.2.1 md), `BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd`
  (5.1 md/json), `nick-aschenbach/dnd-data` (json); **verify each repo's license** + keep
  WotC CC-BY attribution. Avoid `open5e` (mixes non-SRD OGL → breaks SRD-only default).
- **UK content data**: no CC UA translation of SRD exists → ship **EN** SRD; UK columns
  community-filled (set expectation in README).
- **Choices model** (build decisions) — dedicated schema design (P7); easy to get wrong.
- **Spell upcast / cantrip scaling** — semi-structured; schema-design risk (P3).
- **Shared validation** (zod schemas) used by loader/editor/health — build in P2/P3.

---

## Implementation roadmap (phased)
1. **Scaffold** — SvelteKit (**`adapter-static` SPA**) + **pnpm** + lint; test tooling
   (see TESTING.md); **`Storage` interface + node/in-memory impl**; `schemaVersion`
   convention; **frontend conventions pinned** (store shape `activeSystem/activeLocale/
   theme`, CSS token contract, `t()`+`dir`/RTL, route map, thin-component rule, **a11y +
   keyboard nav incl. Tab order & `Ctrl+K`**); `package.json` scripts (pnpm); write
   `docs/*`. **Then (after Rust+MSVC installed)**: `tauri init`, fs/dialog plugins +
   capabilities, Tauri `Storage` impl, data-dir resolution + first-run, `tauri dev`/
   `build` smoke. *(TS side is doable now; Tauri wiring waits on the toolchain.)*
2. **Content sources + config** — multi-root scan, merge, in-memory index, collision
   detection (`collisions.json`), per-file/source toggles, **atomic UTF-8-BOM/CRLF
   writes**, file-watch live reload **ignoring self-writes**.
3. **CSV schema** per type (common + mechanics + L2 + `effects` + linked
   `class_features` + resource defs + per-system overrides; **zod validators**; design
   spell upcast/cantrip-scaling) + **SRD converter script** (CC-BY source → our CSV;
   candidates in Risks; verify licenses + keep attribution) + seed SRD subset.
4. **Rules + effects core** (+ tests) — mods, prof, capacity, passive senses, attack/
   spell DCs, **stacking pipeline + bounded effect interpreter**, optional toggle;
   `5e`/`5.5e` seam; reactive system.
5. **i18n** — runtime catalogs, live switch, EN fallback, RTL, collation, discovery.
6. **Compendium** + **content-health view** — browse/search/sort (system-aware) +
   diagnostics (broken refs, missing translations, collisions, bad rows).
7. **Character schema** (build/runtime split, `schemaVersion`) + store (load/save, photo,
   `log.jsonl`, autosave/backups, bundle, missing-content) + tests.
7.5 **Frontend architecture** (`docs/FRONTEND.md`) — component tree, sheet layout, props
   from core types, store/`$derived` wiring for live switches.
   **Layout model = modular panels + preset views (HYBRID, decided P1).** The UI is built
   from discrete **panels** (HP, combat stats, abilities, skills, attacks, spells,
   actions/maneuvers, conditions/effects, inventory, notes, …). It ships **named views** —
   **Profile · Combat · Inventory · Build** — each a **preset arrangement** of panels.
   The **Inventory view is NOT a list like the spellbook** — it's a **card grid (≈4 across)**:
   each item a card with a **category icon** (weapon/armor/potion/scroll/wondrous glyph — we
   ship **no art**; SRD is text-only), name, key stat (dmg/AC/weight), quantity, and
   equipped/attuned badges, **grouped into sections** (Equipped/attuned · Weapons ·
   Consumables · Gear · Treasure). The icon slot shows a **category emoji by default, replaced
   by the item's image when one is set** (homebrew/user-supplied, like character photos).
   Header shows weight/capacity (imperial+metric) + currency + filter + add. Other views are
   panel arrangements as above
   (Combat = the play sheet already designed). A view has a **fixed stats header** (identity/
   HP, combat tiles, passive senses, abilities) and, below it, a **two-column PANEL AREA** —
   the only customizable zone. **Light per-user customization**: **every panel collapses/
   expands** (chevron) and can be shown/hidden; **panels are drag-reorderable WITHIN the
   two-column area** — drag a block to any slot or the other column; blocks always stay
   **vertically stacked / sequential** in the two columns (masonry order), never free-floating.
   A **free-form absolute canvas stays out of scope** — this constrained drag gives the
   flexibility without the cost. Pick/save a preset. Layouts persist per character; the two
   columns collapse to one per breakpoint (phone over LAN); keyboard-a11y preserved (reorder
   via keyboard too).
   **UI control conventions:** (1) binary **state** on/off (prepared, conditions, auto-calc,
   shield) = **toggle switch** (slider, teal when on) — never checkboxes; (2) **visibility**
   "show/hide on the sheet" (which spells/skills/actions/panels appear) = an **open/closed
   EYE icon** — **open eye tinted teal = shown**, closed eye muted = hidden — used everywhere
   visibility is chosen, distinct from the state switch.
8. **Build/level-up + statgen** — point-buy/array/manual; **level-up flow**;
   **multiclass (+spellcasting)**; XP toggle; free-feat mode.
   **Two edit modes — STRICT vs FREE** (per character, stored, switchable anytime; Strict
   default). **Strict** enforces the rules of the **character's OWN system** (point-buy caps,
   skill-choice counts, class/subclass/feat prereqs, ASI rules, prepared caps, **multiclass
   prereqs which are PER-CLASS** (Wizard INT 13, Fighter STR *or* DEX 13, Cleric WIS 13,
   Sorcerer CHA 13, …; you must meet your current class(es)' AND the new class's — read from
   content data, not hardcoded)) — invalid choices are blocked/flagged. **Free** lets the user set ANY value
   (scores, features, HP, spells, anything) with no validation — for homebrew, imports,
   cross-tool conversions, or fixing; shows a clear "unvalidated" indicator.
   **Strict is system-aware — the 5e and 5.5e build forms DIFFER**: ASI on **species (5e)**
   vs **background (5.5e)**; 5.5e adds **weapon mastery** + **background-granted origin feat**
   + species without ASI; different skill/tool/background mechanics. Validate against the
   bound system, never reinterpret across systems.
9. **Character sheet UI** (responsive, **keyboard-navigable** — Tab order, `Ctrl+K`) —
   all fields (separate sections), **effects panel**, **explain-on-hover/tap stat
   breakdowns (provenance + rule blocks)** — **EVERY auto-calculated value** (AC, save DC,
   attack/spell-attack bonus, ability/skill/save mods, passive senses, max HP, initiative,
   carrying capacity, …) shows a **small hover/focus popover listing what produced it** (each
   `{source, op, amount}` contribution + rule notes); a manually-overridden value instead
   shows a "manual" marker (not a breakdown). **configurable passive senses** (player pins
   which passive skills appear; default Perception/Investigation/Insight), play-state trackers
   (HP/slots/resources/conditions/concentration/equipped/attune) + **round counter**,
   **rests**, dice roller, weight/(opt)capacity imperial+metric, photo, notes, appearance.
   **Action-economy tracker** on a turn bar: **Action · Bonus action · Reaction · Movement**
   (remaining/max ft) — each marks used/available and **resets on a prominent `Next turn`
   button** (which also advances the round). No-roll actions (Dash/Disengage/Dodge/Help/
   Search/Use Object) are picked here, under the relevant slot. **Each slot shows a COUNT as
   pips, not a single on/off** — features grant extras (Fighter **Action Surge** = 2 actions;
   **Haste** = +1 limited action; effects can add a bonus action or reaction), rendered as
   multiple pips (filled = available, dim = used), with the granting source labelled.
   **Slot/resource pips are click-to-set** (same model for spell slots, ki, rage, etc.):
   clicking a **filled** pip empties it and every pip after it (available count = that index);
   clicking an **empty** pip fills it and every pip before it. So clicking the last filled pip
   spends one, clicking the first empty pip restores one — and clicking deep into the row
   sets the count in a single tap.
   **Conditions are MERGED into the Effects panel** (a condition is just an effect of type
   `apply-condition`) — ONE "Effects & conditions" list is the single source of truth for
   active modifiers, each with provenance, duration, a type tag (spell/item/feature/condition)
   and remove; concentration shows inline. The +Condition / +Effect quick-pickers write into
   this same list. **No separate Conditions panel.**
   **Shield = one dedicated toggle button** on the sheet (don/doff the equipped shield in
   one tap → its +2 AC effect turns on/off live, reflected in the AC provenance trace);
   it is a fast play-state control, not buried in inventory.
   **Stat interaction model**: (a) **click any value → set a manual override** (any stat,
   any time, independent of the auto-calc engine); (b) abilities are **tap-to-roll** (check
   or save, each with its own hit target) — the per-ability skills live in the dedicated
   **Skills panel**, not a hover dropdown (which duplicated it); (c) **tap a
   check / save / attack → opens the dice tray PRE-FILLED** (d20 + that modifier, labelled
   with the source) — **never an instant silent roll**; the player can adjust advantage/
   disadvantage, add dice, and tweak the modifier, then **Roll**. The dice tray is a **roll
   builder**: a dice **pool with selectable COUNT per die** (`N × dY`, e.g. 8d6), a flat
   modifier, adv/dis, and a **roll log** — opened from the "last roll" readout on the sheet —
   listing every roll with its source, formula breakdown, total, round, and adv/crit flags
   (rerollable). The log is backed by the character's append-only **`log.jsonl`** → **full
   persistent history across sessions**, grouped by session/date and searchable — NOT capped
   to recent rolls; the panel **scrolls back through the entire history** (virtualized for
   large logs). Each row has a **hover delete (trash)** to drop a roll. Keyboard- and
   touch-equivalent (focus opens the same dropdown; long-press
   to edit a value on touch).
   **Attacks**, **spells**, and **actions/maneuvers** are THREE SEPARATE panels. The
   **attacks panel** lists weapon attacks (melee/ranged, incl. unarmed/thrown). The
   **Actions panel** lists the **full set of standard actions** (system-aware 2014/2024 —
   Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Study, Influence, Utilize/Use
   an Object, Grapple, Shove, Magic/Cast; canonical list ref: crobi 5e quickref
   `https://crobi.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/preview/quickref.html`), with a **show/hide config
   menu** so the user picks which appear. **Roll/contest** actions (Hide, Search, Grapple,
   Shove, Influence, Study) open the roll builder; **no-roll** actions just mark the
   action-economy slots. Class-specific & homebrew actions merge in via the feature-action
   groups (above).
   **Class-specific action lists are NOT hardcoded** — Battle Master **maneuvers**, Monk **ki
   actions**, Rogue **cunning action**, Barbarian **rage**, Sorcerer **metamagic**, Warlock
   **invocations**, Paladin/Cleric **Channel Divinity**, Druid **Wild Shape**, Artificer
   **infusions** are all instances of ONE generic **"feature-action group" panel**: a named
   list of options bound to a class **resource** (superiority dice / ki / sorcery points /
   channel uses / rage / …), shown only for the granting class. Entries come from content CSV;
   **homebrew merges identically** (rows added to the group's type, source-namespaced + per-
   source toggle) — users add custom maneuvers/metamagic/invocations exactly like spells.
   **Grapple/Shove have NO fixed DC** — render
   system-correct: **2014 = a contest** (your Athletics roll vs the target's Athletics/
   Acrobatics, so the "difficulty" is the opponent's roll, shown as `contest`, not a static
   number), **2024 = the target saves vs a derived DC `8 + STR mod + prof`**. Jump →
   Athletics only if contested. The rest are quick references / action-economy markers.
   The **spells panel** lists
   all spells and is **independently configurable**: the user **groups spells however they
   want** (by level / school / prepared / concentration / custom user-defined groups),
   can **pin frequently-used spells** to a Favourites group at the top, and can **hide the
   panel entirely** (non-casters). **Spell preparation is modeled**: *prepared* casters
   (cleric/druid/wizard/paladin/artificer) keep a known/spellbook pool and **prepare a
   subset** — per-spell **prepare toggle**, a **prepared-count tracker** (cap = class +
   ability mod); a **rule-option allows OVER-CAP preparation** (off by default — when on, you
   may prepare past the limit and the counter shows e.g. 12/11), always-prepared/domain spells
   flagged, rituals castable unprepared where
   the class allows; *known* casters (sorcerer/bard/warlock/ranger) skip prepping (all known
   are castable). The panel can filter/group **prepared vs full list**. On the **play view**
   it shows only the **castable set** (cantrips + prepared + pinned) — bounded by the prepare
   cap (~11) + cantrips, NOT the full spellbook (which is routinely 30+); a filter switches to
   *All* or opens the **spell-management view** — a clearly separate control (not the cast
   tap): a **two-pane** screen, left = a **list of every spell with per-row buttons** (👁
   show/hide on the play sheet · ▢ prepare · ☆ pin), right = the selected spell's **wiki
   detail rendered from our content CSVs**. (Casting happens only by tapping a spell row on
   the play sheet — distinct from managing.) Tapping either an attack or a damaging/
   attack spell opens the roll builder in **attack mode**: ① **to-hit** (d20 + attack bonus,
   adv/dis) vs AC, then ② **damage** (weapon/spell dice + mod) with a **Crit toggle**.
   **Save-based attacks/spells skip to-hit** and show the target save (ability + DC) with
   **half-on-save**. Weapon properties carry through (versatile 1H/2H, thrown, two-weapon,
   damage type); cantrip/slot scaling sets spell dice; casting spends the slot.
   **Spell-row layout: effect-first + resolution tag.** The **spell save DC and spell attack
   bonus are caster-wide constants** (`8 + prof + ability mod`) shown ONCE in the panel header,
   never per row. Each row shows the **effect** (damage/effect) in a fixed column + a small
   **resolution tag**: `attack roll` (YOU roll vs AC — gold) · `<ABILITY> save` (the TARGET
   rolls vs your DC — crimson, ability varies per spell) · `auto-hit` (teal) · `—` (no
   attack/save). Same in 5e/5.5e.
   **Crit damage method = a rule-option**: *classic* (roll DOUBLE the dice) or *loyal* (one
   set of dice **maxed** + one set **rolled**); default classic, switchable in settings and
   per-roll.
10. **Content editor UI** — add/save custom content (incl. effects) into homebrew CSVs.
11. **Theming + settings** — light/dark + custom themes; settings screen with unified
    **rule-options toggles** (capacity, encumbrance, free-feat, xp-mode, multiclass,
    effects-engine on/off, language, system, theme) — all live.
12. **Export/print + roster + content-pack sharing** — good PDF/print; manage many
    characters; **export a `source` as a shareable pack** (+ import via collision/health).
13. **Package** via **`pnpm tauri build`** (Win `.exe`/`.msi`, Linux AppImage/`.deb`) +
    README (install, add-content-via-CSV, portable vs app-data mode).

Security tasks are woven across phases per [SECURITY.md].

## Verification
Automated coverage and conventions live in [TESTING.md] (suites map to phases; run
`pnpm test`). Manual acceptance per feature: live switches (no reload); sources
(2nd CSV, homebrew folder, toggle off, collision resolve); live reload (edit CSV on
disk); portability (move JSON to fresh install → renders + flags missing; bundle opens
anywhere); play loop (damage → rest → restore; concentration; level-up; multiclass
slots); sheet (effects panel auto-vs-manual, photo, weight+metric, capacity toggle,
print/export).
