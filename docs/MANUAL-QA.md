# Manual QA checklist (refactor safety)

Per refactor: what to **click-verify in the running app** (`pnpm dev` / `pnpm tauri dev`), because
unit tests don't cover UI wiring. Each entry: the change, the files, and the exact things to check so
a refactor can't silently kill functionality. Tick when verified in a running build.

Legend: ☐ not verified · ☑ verified in app · ⚠️ behavior intentionally changed (check it's the new behavior)

## CH1 · dice roller unified (`rules/dice.ts`) — commit d660047

Files: `rules/dice.ts` (new), `combat/state.svelte.ts` (`doRoll`/`rollDiceNow`/`pushRoll`),
`combat/helpers.ts` (`parseDice`→`parseDicePool`), `components/WikiDetail.svelte` (`rollDice`).

Combat sheet:
- ☐ Tap a **skill / save / attack** → rolls; toast shows total + breakdown (`d20(x) +N`).
- ☐ **Advantage / disadvantage** roll → shows kept d20 and the dropped one (`d20 X (drop Y)`).
- ☐ **Bless / Bane** active → the roll picks up the signed bonus die (`+d4(x)` / `−d4(x)`).
- ☐ **Custom roll tray** (Alt/Ctrl-click a stat) → set dice + mod + adv, roll → same result as a tap.
- ☐ Cast a **damage** spell → rolls damage; cast a **buff/utility** spell → `Cast X` log marker only.
- ☐ Roll **log**: newest first, capped (200).

Compendium / spellbook:
- ⚠️ Monster **HP dice** button (`16d12 + 80`) → now rolls EVERY dice group (old bug: only first). Check total is plausible (~120–170, not ~8+80).
- ☐ Spell/attack **damage roll** button in WikiDetail → rolls, toast shows formula.

## Strict typing pass (exactOptionalPropertyTypes + noUncheckedIndexedAccess)

Mostly type-only, but `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` fixes add runtime guards (`?? fallback`, early
returns) that *could* alter behavior if mishandled. Entries added per risky fix below.

### `adv` → `advantage` rename + roll result is now `advantageRoll: {kept, dropped}`

Files: `rules/dice.ts` (`Rolled.advantageRoll`), `combat/state.svelte.ts` (`rollAdvantage`, `pushRoll`),
`combat/helpers.ts` (`rollEffectsFor` returns `advantage`), `combat/CombatMenus.svelte` (log render).
Type-only + render field rename; behavior should be identical.
- ☐ Adv/disadv roll → **tray history** line and the **full roll log** both show `d20 <kept>` with the
  dropped d20 struck through (same as before the rename).
- ☐ The tray's advantage/normal/disadvantage segmented toggle still sets the roll mode.

### exactOptionalPropertyTypes enabled — conditional-field construction

Files: `content/detail.ts` (`availableTo`, ability `save`), `content/homebrew.ts` (`options`),
`character/spellcasting.ts` (`cantrips`/`prepared`), `rules/spellcasting.ts` (`forcedUpcast`),
`rules/pipeline.ts` (`notes`), `character/repository.ts` (roster `error`). These now omit a field when
absent instead of setting it to `undefined`. Verify the consumers still render:
- ☐ Compendium spell detail: **"Available to"** class list shows (spells that have it) / is absent (others).
- ☐ Monster/statblock detail: saving-throw values render only for abilities that have a save.
- ☐ Homebrew add-content form: enum fields (systems, category…) still render their **dropdown options**.
- ☐ A **corrupt character** in the roster still shows with its error message.

### noUncheckedIndexedAccess — guards added at array/record access (81 sites)

Mostly `m?.[1] ?? ''` on regex matches (no behavior change) + `!` in tests. A few added a runtime
guard that drops an item if it were unexpectedly absent — verify nothing legitimate disappears:
- ☐ Combat sheet: **all 18 skills** still render (each row now behind `{#if sk}`), and taps still roll.
- ☐ Combat: **passive senses** (Perception / Investigation / Insight) still show (the passives list now
  filters to skills present in the sheet).
- ☐ Combat: **level-up** still toasts the class + new level (toast now guarded by `if (cls)`).
- ☐ Combat header: **class name + level** still shows (guarded first-class lookup).
- ☐ Compendium: switching **type chips** and **group-by** still works (first-option fallbacks).
- ☐ Build review panel: **Spell DC** stat shows for casters (guarded `classes[0]`).

## CH2 · effect grammar unified (one `parseEffect`)

Files: `effects/index.ts` (parser + `EFFECT_KIND` const + `matchesTarget` export), `rules/dice.ts`
(`parseDiceTerm`), `derive.ts`, `combat/state` (slotMax), `combat/helpers` (rollEffectsFor, effectTag),
`build/state` (speciesFixedAbilities). All token reads route through one parser now — verify every
effect-driven feature still behaves:
- ☐ **Resistance/immunity/vulnerability**: an effect with `resist_immune:immune:poison` shows poison
  under Immunities (and `resist_immune:fire` → Resistances); the defenses panel is correct.
- ☐ **Resource pools**: a feature granting `grant_resource:rage:3:long` shows a 3-pip rage tracker.
- ☐ **Granted proficiency / condition**: `grant_proficiency:stealth` marks stealth proficient; an
  `apply_condition:*` effect applies its condition tokens.
- ☐ **Ability bonuses** (species +2, etc.) still cascade into scores in the builder.
- ☐ **Roll effects**: Bless/Bane add the bonus die; an `advantage:*` effect flips a roll to advantage.
- ☐ **Action economy**: Action Surge / Haste (`flat_bonus:action+1`) still add an action pip.
- ☐ **Effects panel tags**: custom modifiers render readable tags ("AC +2", "DEX save +1").

## CH3 · pip trackers unified (one `pipClick`, available-left/spent-right)

Files: `combat/helpers.ts` (`pipClick`), `combat/state` (usePip/slotClick/resourceClick),
`combat/+page.svelte` (action + resource pip render flipped). Behavior changed intentionally:
- ☐ **Resource pips** (rage/ki/…): clicking the RIGHTMOST available pip spends ONE (was: clicking any
  pip spent the whole pool — the bug). Available pips are on the LEFT, spent fill in from the RIGHT.
- ☐ **Action-economy pips** (action/bonus/reaction): now render available-left/spent-right too (was
  used-from-left). Spending + restoring still works; clicking a spent pip restores it and those left.
- ☐ **Spell-slot pips**: unchanged (they were already this model); confirm spend/restore still works.
- ☐ All three feel identical now: click an available pip → spend from it rightward; click a spent pip
  → restore from it leftward.

## CH4 part 2 (BVM-1) · draft fields regrouped into one `draft` object

Files: `build/state.svelte.ts` (20 `$state` fields → `draft = $state<DraftState>(blankDraft())`;
`draftFromCharacter`; assembled derived renamed `draft`→`assembled`), `build/+page.svelte` (all
`b.X` binds → `b.draft.X`). Guarded by svelte-check (0 errors) + the hydrate→assemble net, but the
whole builder UI moved — smoke-test it:
- ☐ **New character**: name, species (+ sub-option), background, class(es) + subclass, level steppers,
  ability method (point-buy/array/manual) + scores, skills/expertise, languages, feats/ASI slots,
  spells, inventory — each control still edits and the live preview updates.
- ☐ **Create** writes the character and opens Combat.
- ☐ **Edit / level-up** (`?edit=` / `?levelup=`): the sheet hydrates with the saved choices; changing
  them updates the preview; save overwrites (same id, play-state kept).
- ⚠️ **Stale-leak fix**: build char A (set an ASI/feat slot), then edit char B without reloading — B no
  longer inherits A's slotFeats/boost picks (draft is now replaced wholesale on hydrate).

## CVM-bug1/2 · concentration wired + conditions per-system

Files: `combat/helpers.ts` (SpRow `ref`+`conc`, spellRow), `combat/state.svelte.ts` (`conc`,
`clearConcentration`, `cast`, `conditionList`), `combat/+page.svelte` (indicator is now a button).
- ☐ Cast a **concentration spell** (e.g. Bless) → the ◈ Concentration indicator appears with that
  spell's name; casting a DIFFERENT concentration spell replaces it; casting a non-concentration
  spell doesn't change it.
- ☐ **Tap the indicator** → concentration stops (indicator disappears).
- ☐ Add-condition menu lists the conditions of the **character's own edition** (a 5e character shows
  5e conditions, a 5.5e character 5.5e) — not always 5.5e.

## UBUG-2 + UBUG-5 · attack-spell to-hit + resource-spend toast

Files: `combat/state.svelte.ts` (`cast`, `resourceClick`).
- ☐ Cast an **attack cantrip/spell with damage** (Fire Bolt): now rolls the **to-hit** first, THEN
  damage — two entries in the log + two toasts (was: damage only, no to-hit).
- ☐ Cast a **save/auto** spell (Fireball / Healing Word): still one damage/healing roll (unchanged).
- ☐ Cast a non-damage **attack** spell: rolls the to-hit (unchanged).
- ☐ **Weapon attack** (equipped weapon): now rolls the **to-hit d20 AND the weapon damage dice**
  (was: only the d20). Two log entries / toasts. Alt-click still opens the to-hit tray for manual play.
- ☐ Click a **resource pip** (rage/ki/…): now toasts "<Name> used/restored — N of M left".
